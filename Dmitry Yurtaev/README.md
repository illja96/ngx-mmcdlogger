# MMCd Datalogger
Web automotive diagnostic and datalogging tool compatible with many pre-OBDII (1990-1994) Mitsubishi vehicles.

# About the Hardware
All following info has been verified on my Mitsubishi Galant E33A (4G63 SOHC), but it should apply on other pre-OBDII ECUs as well.
There's absolutely NO WARRANTY on info and software, you can use it at your own risk.
How to make your own datalogging cable...

ALDL diagnostic connector:

![ALDL diagnostic connector](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/diag-conn.jpg)

When pin (10) is shorted to ground (12) ECU enters diagnostic mode.
In this mode pin (1) is used to exchange diagnostic data with a scan tool. Serial communication is done using 1953 baud, 8 bit, 1 stop bit, no parity, TTL(?) levels.
I used the following RS-232 adapter (taken from Club DSM Colorado):

![RS-232 adapter 1 schematics](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/ecu-rs232.jpg)

I replaced MAX233 with ST232BD, added required external capacitors and power indication LED:

# About the Protocol
The protocol is simple: request-reply. Request and reply are one-byte message.
I have found requests and reply interpretations on the web one a web page called "DSM Open Source Datalogger Project".
I've found no source there, so I've decided to make one... ;)
There's what I found:

# Features
You can continously monitor, graph and record a log of up to 32 parameters (sensors). Logs can be reviewed later.

Main form:
![Main](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/Main.gif)

Tap "New" to start a new log or tap a log name to open an existing one.
You'll see the log form:
![Review](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/Review.gif)

Available parameters (sensors) are divided into four banks of up to eight sensors each. Ar the right top corner is sensor bank selector (1, 2, 3, 4). Below are contents of current bank. Each sensor displayed as sensor name and sensor value.
Tapping at value (the right part) toggles a graph for that sensor. Tapping at sensor name (the left part) toggles sensor capture (more on that later). At the bottom right is mode selector (Review, Monitor). In Review mode recorded log is displayed inside a graph window.
In the middle is a graph window. It can be scrolled using a scrollbar at the bottom or by tapping inside and dragging the cursor. Above graph window is the time when current sample was captured.
Monitor mode looks like this:
![Monitor](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/Monitor.gif)
![Monitor numeric](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/Monitor-numeric.gif)
 
Graph checkbox toggles between graph and numeric mode.
Unchecking "Pause" starts communicaion with the ECU. Selected sensors (ones that have their name highlighted) are polled and graphed.
Checking "Log" turns on log writing. Then it can be reviewed later. At the left bottom there's an indication of sample rate and the sensor being polled. Sample rates dropes when more sensors are enabled.
Test mode:
![Test](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/Test.gif)

Test mode allows read/erase fault codes, activate relays/solenoids and disable injectors. When faults are displayed you can tap code to read what it means.
![Prefs](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/Prefs.gif)
![VSPD](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/VSPD.gif)
 
Preferences dialog lets you define 8 custom ECU locations to log, if you know what they mean. Also there's serial communication speed and measurment system for temperature values (Metric, English and no conversion Numeric).
![Alarms](https://github.com/illja96/mmcdlogger/blob/main/Dmitry Yurtaev/Alarms.gif)

Version 1.3 adds audible alarms support for monitor mode. Sor each sensor you can define alarm threshold, polarity (greater or less than) and choose one of 4 sound pitches.

# Change Log
01-04-2004:
- Shawn Poulson has set up a page for MMCd Tools at Sourceforge a while ago.
  The MMCd Tools are an open-source set of support applications for handling datalogs.
  It helps to uploads datalogs to PC during HotSync and convert datalogs to CSV or Excel spreadsheets.

04-07-2003: v1.5b
- Added injector duty cycle calculation
- Rearranged sensors (sorry) to make room for INJD

03-07-2003: v1.4c
- If running on a Handspring device call HsKeyboardEnable(false) before trying to open serial port.
Should work on Visors now.

01-07-2003: v1.4b
- Fixed a bug that caused graph scrolling to hang under Visor emulaton.
  It is still feels unresponsive, as event cueue is keeped cluttered by
  penMove events. Wonder if it is the case on real thing.

30-06-2003: v1.4a
- Splitted Edit form into Edit, Test and Debug.
- Moved Edit and Debug modes into they own forms accessible from main menu.
- Added high-density screen support.
  MMCd won't run on Tungstens though, because of limitations of serial port.
- Added double-density icons.
- Fixed a few double-density compatibility isues (cosmetic).
- Added MVIC button to test form.
- Minor conversion corrections for O2 and fuel trims.
- Replaced custom scrollbar with the stock one in Edit form.
- Splitted mmcd.c to test.c and debug.c.
- Moved resource ids definitions from mmcd.h to resource.h.
- Updated help for Preferences dialog.
- Updated Makefile.

20-06-2003: v1.3d
- Another bug in main form: now I was fooled by MemPtrResize.
  If there was more than 16 logs application crashed. Fixed.
- Added 'Backup' attribute indication to main form (dot in the end of log name).
- Added 'Backup on HotSync' checkbox to 'Rename Log' dialog.
- Permanently turned on Debug mode.

20-06-2003: v1.3c
- BUG: Main form code was broken, as it didn't take scroll position into account when calculating which log to open.
  As a result, it was possible to open only 11 first logs.
  Fixed.
- Turned out, that StrCompare() is using some non-obvious method of string compare and there's no plain strcmp() equivalent prior to PalmOS 4.0.
  Rewritten compare() in C.
- Inverted 'S' (P/S load present) bit in f_FLG2().
- Increased precision of conversion for FTxx, O2 voltage.
- In test mode renamed Faults to DTCs (for Diagnostic Trouble Codes).

17-06-2003: v1.3b
- Fixed a small bug with 'Hide' in Review mode: when log contains sample for custom sensor and this sensor is disabled in prefs, HideUnused() shown it anyway leaving a hole in button bank.
- Updated air intake and coolant temperature conversion routines.
  Now with ones found in DSMlink source.
- Added O2-F sensor at 0x3e, renamed O2 to O2-R, deleted AIRV.
- Rearranged sensors.
- Some code cleanup.

16-06-2003: v1.3a
- Added 'Graph' checkbox to Monitor mode.
  When unchecked, graph is replaced by large numeric display of selected sensor.
  Button panel becomes single-selection.
- Added 'Alarms' menu.
  Allows to define alarm threshold and sound for each sensor.
- 'Graph' checkbox is controlled by hardware button 2
- In Monitor/numeric mode hardware button 1 cycles selection thru sensors set for capture.
- In Review mode hardbuttons 1 and 2 move cursor left/right.
- PageUp/PageDown hardware buttons change current bank.
- Hardware button are blocked 1..4 in Edit form whenever unused.
- State of 'H' button, numeric mode and selection is saved on exit.
- Added PalmOS version check (>= 3.5) at startup.
- Removed 'Compatible graphcis' from prefs as it appears unuseful.
- Added 'Alarms' checkbox to prefs.
- Fixed a bug in barometric pressure conversion routine.

11-06-2003: v1.2
- Fixed (I hope) timing advance conversion.
- Added English-mode pressure conversion (in psi).
- in Monitor mode Log and Pause checkboxen can be activated by hardware buttons 3 and 4
  
06-06-2003: v1.1
- Applied patches submitted by Shawn Poulson
- Reduced timeout in EvtGetEvent() as 1 second timeout breaks graph scrolling code.
- Replaced lookup table by XPOSE() macro
- Moved bank selection buttons 1 pixel left off 'H' to make 1-pixel gap between borders as it looks more pleasant to me :)
- Bumped version to 1.1

Shawn Poulson

03-06-2003: v1.0d-shawn-2.1
- Update user interface
- Update display of sensors in Hide Unused mode, so that they are displayed correctly in column orientation. 
  As put by Dmitry:
  ```
  1 -     1 -   and not... 1 -     1 -
  - -     2 -              - -     2 -
  2 4     3 -              2 4     4 -
  3 -     4 -              3 -     3 -
  ```
- Update optimization wait in main loop by instead using the commented code block for EvtGetEvent(...).
  This is cleaner and doesn't slow down the GUI by sleeping.

01-06-2003: v1.0d-shawn-2.0
- Update user interface
- Instead of 5th 'X' bank, use 'H' pushbutton in upper right to toggle "Hide Unused" mode.
- In Review mode, it will dynamically show only sensors logged at the selected graph point.
- In Monitor mode, it will show only sensors captured or graphed.

30-05-2003: v1.0d-shawn-1.0
- Update user inteface
- Add a 5th 'X' bank that, when selected, will show up to 8 sensors captured or graphed.
- Add optimization wait in the main loop to keep cpu utilization low.

23-04-2003: v1.0d
- Added "Compatible graphics" checkbox to prefs dialog.
  Looks like direct access to bitmap bits doesn't work on Sony CLIE...

16-04-2003: v1.0c
- Fixed a bug with prefs.
  When running for the first time default preferences get trashed.
  Added "Default" button to prefs dialog.
  (thanks to Steven_GT)
- Removed call to BmpGetBitsDepth unavalable prior to PalmOS 4.
  (thanks to Jeff Oberholtzer)
- try to open serPortCradlePort if serPortCradleRS232Port fails.

31-03-2003: v1.0b
- Implemented baud rate and measure system in prefs dialog
- Fixed Purge command in Test form. Pressure, EGR and Boost need testing.

28-03-2003: 
- Added scrollbar to main form (it still needs some work, though)
- Implemented test mode.
  Injectors, Fuel pump, Fault erase should work as expected.
  Fault codes are not checked throughly - some assistance needed.
  Others may work, may not, may be permutated
- Removed Debug mode
- Added prefs dialog

27-01-2003: v1.0a
- Main form doesn't scroll, so up to 11 logs can be selected
- Test mode not implemented yet and contains debugging stuff
- Settings dialog not implemented
