CHANGELOG

23-07-2004: v1.5d
- Sourceforge release

01-04-2004:
- Shawn Poulson has set up a page for MMCd Tools at Sourceforge a while
  ago. The MMCd Tools are an open-source set of support applications for
  handling datalogs. It helps to uploads datalogs to PC during HotSync
  and convert datalogs to CSV or Excel spreadsheets.

04-07-2003: v1.5b
- Added injector duty cycle calculation
- Rearranged sensors (sorry) to make room for INJD

04-07-2003: v1.5a
- Added injector duty cycle calculation

03-07-2003: v1.4c
- If running on a Handspring device call HsKeyboardEnable(false) before
  trying to open serial port. Should work on Visors now.

01-07-2003: v1.4b
- Fixed a bug that caused graph scrolling to hang under Visor emulaton.
  It is still feels unresponsive, as event cueue is keeped cluttered by
  penMove events. Wonder if it is a case on real thing.

30-06-2003: v1.4a
- Splitted Edit form into Edit, Test and Debug.
- Moved Edit and Debug modes into they own forms accessible from main menu.
- Added high-density screen support. MMCd won't run on Tungstens though,
  because of limitations of serial port.
- Added double-density icons.
- Fixed a few double-density compatibility isues (cosmetic).
- Added MVIC button to test form.
- Minor conversion corrections for O2 and fuel trims.
- Replaced custom scrollbar with the stock one in Edit form.
- Splitted mmcd.c to test.c and debug.c.
- Moved resource ids definitions from mmcd.h to resource.h.
- Updated help for Preferences dialog.
- Updated Makefile.

20-06-2003: v1.3d
- Another bug in main form: now I was fooled by MemPtrResize. If there
  was more than 16 logs application crashed. Fixed.
- Added 'Backup' attribute indication to main form (dot in the end of
  log name).
- Added 'Backup on HotSync' checkbox to 'Rename Log' dialog.
- Permanently turned on Debug mode.

20-06-2003: v1.3c
- BUG: Main form code was broken, as it didn't take scrolling into
  account when opening existing log. as a result, it was possible
  to open only 11 first logs. Fixed.
- Turned out, that StrCompare() is using some non-obvious method of
  string compare and there's no plain strcmp() equivalent prior to
  PalmOS 4.0. Rewritten compare() in C.
- Inverted 'S' (P/S load present) bit in f_FLG2().
- Increased precision of conversion for FTxx, O2 voltage.
- In test mode renamed Faults to DTCs (for Diagnostic Trouble Codes).

17-06-2003: v1.3b
- Fixed a small bug with 'Hide' in Review mode: when log contains sample
  for custom sensor and this sensor is disabled in prefs, HideUnused()
  shown it anyway leaving a hole in bank.
- Updated air intake and coolant temperature conversion routines. Now with
  ones found in DSMlink source.
- Added O2-F sensor at 0x3e, renamed O2 to O2-R, deleted AIRV.
- Rearranged sensors.
- Some code cleanup.

16-06-2003: v1.3a
- Added 'Graph' checkbox to Monitor mode. When unchecked, graph is replaced
  by large numeric display of selected sensor. Button panel becomes
  single-selection.
- Added 'Alarms' menu. Allows to define alarm threshold and sound for
  each sensor.
- 'Graph' checkbox is controlled by hardware button 2
- In Monitor/numeric mode hardware button 1 cycles selection thru 
  sensors set for capture.
- In Review mode hardbuttons 1 and 2 move cursor left/right.
- PageUp/PageDown hardware buttons change current bank.
- Hardware button are blocked 1..4 in Edit form whenever unused.
- State of 'H' button, numeric mode and selection is saved on exit.
- Added PalmOS version check (>= 3.5) at startup.
- Removed 'Compatible graphcis' from prefs as it appears unuseful.
- Added 'Alarms' checkbox to prefs.
- Fixed a bug in barometric pressure conversion routine.

11-06-2003: v1.2
- Fixed (I hope) timing advance conversion.
- Added English-mode pressure conversion (in psi).
- in Monitor mode 'Log' and 'Pause' checkboxen can be activated by hardware
  buttons 3 and 4

06-06-2003: v1.1
- Applied patches submitted by Shawn Pulson <spoulson@rcn.com>
- Reduced timeout in EvtGetEvent() as 1 second timeout breaks graph
  scrolling code.
- Replaced lookup table by XPOSE() macro
- Moved bank selection buttons 1 pixel left off 'H' to make 1-pixel
  gap between borders as it looks more pleasant to me :)
- Bumped version to 1.1

03-06-2003: v1.0d-shawn-2.1
- Update user interface
- Update display of sensors in Hide Unused mode, so that they are
  displayed correctly in column orientation.  As put by Dmitry:
  1 -     1 -   and not... 1 -     1 -
  - -     2 -              - -     2 -
  2 4     3 -              2 4     4 -
  3 -     4 -              3 -     3 -
- Update optimization wait in main loop by instead using the commented
  code block for EvtGetEvent(...).  This is cleaner and doesn't slow
  down the GUI by sleeping.

01-06-2003: v1.0d-shawn-2.0
- Update user interface
- Instead of 5th 'X' bank, use 'H' pushbutton in upper right to
  toggle "Hide Unused" mode.
- In Review mode, it will dynamically show only sensors logged at
  the selected graph point.
- In Monitor mode, it will show only sensors captured or graphed.

30-05-2003: v1.0d-shawn-1.0
- Update user inteface
- Add a 5th 'X' bank that, when selected, will show up to 8 sensors
  captured or graphed.
- Add optimization wait in the main loop to keep cpu utilization low.

23-04-2003: v1.0d
- Added "Compatible graphics" checkbox to prefs dialog. Looks like
  direct access to bitmap bits doesn't work on Sony CLIE...

16-04-2003: v1.0c
- Fixed a bug with prefs. When running for the first time default
  preferences get trashed. Added "Default" button to prefs dialog.
  (thanks to Steven_GT)
- Removed call to BmpGetBitsDepth unavalable prior to PalmOS 4.
  (thanks to Jeff Oberholtzer)
- try to open serPortCradlePort if serPortCradleRS232Port fails.

31-03-2003: v1.0b
- Implemented baud rate and measure system in prefs dialog
- Fixed Purge command in Test form. Pressure, EGR and Boost need testing.

28-03-2003: 
- Added scrollbar to main form (it still needs some work, though)
- Implemented test mode. Injectors, Fuel pump, Fault erase should work
  as expected. Fault codes are not checked throughly - some assistance
  needed. Others may work, may not, may be permutated
- Removed Debug mode
- Added prefs dialog

27-01-2003: v1.0a
- Main form doesn't scroll, so up to 11 logs can be selected
- Test mode not implemented yet and contains debugging stuff
- Settings dialog not implemented
